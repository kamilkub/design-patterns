# Coding Design Patterns

### Builder Designer Pattern
The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. 
<br>The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
<br>
<br>
The Builder design pattern solves problems like:
* How can a class (the same construction process) create different representations of a complex object?
* How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?
