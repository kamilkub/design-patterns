# Coding Design Patterns

### Builder Designer Pattern
The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. 
<br>The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
<br>
<br>
The Builder design pattern solves problems like:
* How can a class (the same construction process) create different representations of a complex object?
* How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?

### Singleton Designer Pattern
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

The Builder design pattern solves problems like:
* One instance of a class through entire application lifecycle
* Global access to class without overriding by other threads
