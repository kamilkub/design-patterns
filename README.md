# Coding Design Patterns

### Builder Design Pattern
The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. 
<br>The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
<br>
<br>
The Builder design pattern solves problems like:
* How can a class (the same construction process) create different representations of a complex object?
* How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?

### Singleton Design Pattern
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

The Builder design pattern solves problems like:
* One instance of a class through entire application lifecycle
* Global access to class without overriding by other threads

### Adapter Design Pattern
Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

The Adapter design pattern solves problems like:
* How make two incompatible interfaces understand each other?

### Bridge Design Pattern
Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently.

The Bridge design pattern solves problems and has advantages such as:
* How make an interface cross-platform supportive?
* Easily extendable
